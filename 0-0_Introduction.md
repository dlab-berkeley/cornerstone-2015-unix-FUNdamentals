# Introduction

### Motivation

This is not a computer:

Think about the many ways you have to interact with computers - things like:

* You use your office suite to create a spreadsheet
* You use a language (like SAS) to manipulate data
* You use a web browser to get information from a computer somewhere else

These methods of interaction all have different levels of knowledge required to use them effectively along with different amounts of power they give you. Generally speaking, these two features are correlated; i.e. the more things there are between you and the computer:

1.  The less powerful you become

2.  The more bugs you get

3.  The more money you pay for the privilege

### Why Bother?

Why learn to program?

1.   *Practical Efficiency*
    Computers are phenomenal at doing all the repetitive stuff that you find to be both boring and below your pay grade.

2.   *New Tools.*
    Some things are impossible, or nearly impossible to do, by pointing at things with a mouse and clicking on them.

3.   *Big Data.*
    The increasing amount of available information creates exciting opportunities for analytics, but also introduces many constraints on statistical computing. Meeting these requires that you learn the basics of interacting with software languages.

4.   *Work Smarter.*
    (Quality) programming can open the door to cleaner analysis, easier collaboration, and better security.

### Learning Objectives

> The basic learning objective is for you to understand enough about Unix,
> version control, networking, and programming, to function effectively in
> an environment where many individuals are collaborating on software that
> is evaluated on shared resources

Specifically, by the end of this week, we want everyone here be able to:

* Understand basic programming terminologies and workflows
* Navigate the Unix file system
* Use essential Unix commands in bash
* Write your own shell script
* Clone, add, commit, and push with Git
* Get help
