# The Unix Shell: Scripts

> ## Learning Objectives
>
> *   Write a shell script that runs a command or series of commands for a fixed set of files.
> *   Run a shell script from the command line.
> *   Write a shell script from shell's history.
> *   Explain the importance of comments in scripts.

We are finally ready to see what makes the shell such a powerful programming environment. We are going to take the commands we repeat frequently and save them in files so that we can re-run all those operations again later by typing a single command.

### Writing a script

For historical reasons, a bunch of commands saved in a file is usually called a **shell script**, but make no mistake: these are actually small programs.

Let's start by going back to `articles` and creating a file called `group.sh`:

~~~ {.input}
$ cd ~/programming-fundamentals/data/articles
$ touch group.sh
$ nano group.sh
~~~
~~~
cat africa*.txt | wc -l
~~~

This is a variation on command we created earlier: It concatenates all of the africa files into one large text files containing all africa articles.

Remember, we are *not* running it as a command just yet: we are putting the commands in a file. 

### Running a script

Once we have saved the file, we can ask the shell to execute the commands it contains. 

First we have to tell the shell what program the script is in. If we want to run a Python script, we would enter in `python` first. If R, then `r` and so on.

Our shell is called `bash`, so we run the following command:

~~~ {.input}
$ bash group.sh
~~~
~~~ {.output}
136
~~~

Sure enough, our script's output is exactly what we would get if we ran that pipeline directly. It concatenated all of the africa files and then counted the number of lines, which is 136 (one line for each article).

> keyboard. When editing programs, therefore, you must either use a plain
> text editor, or be careful to save files as plain text.

### Variables in Scripts

What if we want concatenate an arbitrary group of files? We could edit `group.sh` each time to change the filename, but that would probably take longer than just retyping the command.

Instead, let's edit `group.sh` and replace `africa*.txt` with a special variable called `"$@"`:

~~~ {.input}
$ nano group.sh
~~~
~~~ {.output}
cat "$@" | wc -l
~~~

Inside a shell script, `$1` means "the first filename (or other parameter) on the command line". `$2` means the second and so on. But in this case, we can't use `$1`, `$2`, and so on because we don't know how many files there are.
Instead, we use the special variable `$@`, which means, "All of the command-line parameters to the shell script." So (`"$@"` is equivalent to `"$1"` `"$2"` ...)

We put `$@` inside double-quotes to handle the case of parameters containing spaces. 

~~~ {.input}
$ bash group.sh africa*.txt
~~~
~~~ {.output}
136
~~~

or on a different file like this:

~~~ {.input}
$ bash group.sh asia*.txt
~~~
~~~ {.output}
145
~~~

### Commenting

This works, but it may take the next person who reads `group.sh` a moment to figure out what it does. We can improve our script by adding some **comments** at the top:

~~~ {.input}
$ cat group.sh
~~~
~~~ {.output}
# Concatenates a group of files and returns the total number of lines.
# Usage: group.sh files
cat "$@" | wc -l
~~~

A comment starts with a `#` character and runs to the end of the line.
The computer ignores comments, but they're invaluable for helping people understand and use scripts.

> process standard input, so it just sits there and waits for us to give
> it some data interactively. From the outside, though, all we see is it
> sitting there: the script doesn't appear to do anything.

### Redirecting

We can use our script to redirect output files, too. Let's change the script to just:

~~~ {.input}
$ cat group.sh
~~~
~~~ {.output}
# Concatenates a group of files and returns the total number of lines.
# Usage: group.sh files
cat "$@" 
~~~

Now we can use the `>` trick to output our result.

~~~ {.input}
$ bash group.sh asia*.txt > all-asia.txt
$ cat all-asia.txt
~~~

The only caveat is that each time you modify the script, you should check that the comment is still accurate: an explanation that sends the reader in the wrong direction is worse than none at all.

### Scripts from History

Now, suppose we have just run a series of commands that did something useful --- for example, that created a graph we'd like to use in a paper.
We'd like to be able to re-create the graph later if we need to, so we want to save the commands in a file. Instead of typing them in again (and potentially getting them wrong) we can do this:

~~~ {.input}
$ history | tail -4 > redo-figure-3.sh
~~~

The file `redo-figure-3.sh` now contains:

~~~
297 goostats -r NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
298 goodiff stats-NENE01729B.txt /data/validated/01729.txt > 01729-differences.txt
299 cut -d ',' -f 2-3 01729-differences.txt > 01729-time-series.txt
300 ygraph --format scatter --color bw --borders none 01729-time-series.txt figure-3.png
~~~

After a moment's work in an editor to remove the serial numbers on the commands, we have a completely accurate record of how we created that figure.

> $ history | tail -5
>   173  cd /tmp
>   174  ls
>   175  mkdir bakup
>   176  mv bakup backup
>   177  history | tail -5
> $ history | tail -5 | colrm 1 7
> bash group.sh
> bash group.sh asia*.txt > all-asia.txt
> ls all-asia.txt
> cat all-asia.txt
> history | tail -5 | colrm 1 7
> ~~~

In practice, most people develop shell scripts by running commands at the shell prompt a few times to make sure they're doing the right thing, then saving them in a file for re-use.

This style of work allows people to recycle what they discover about their data and their workflow with one call to `history` and a bit of editing to clean up the output and save it as a shell script.

## Exercises

#### Challenge 1

Leah has several hundred data files, each of which is formatted like this:

~~~
2013-11-05,deer,5
2013-11-05,rabbit,22
2013-11-05,raccoon,7
2013-11-06,rabbit,19
2013-11-06,deer,2
2013-11-06,fox,1
2013-11-07,rabbit,18
2013-11-07,bear,1
~~~

Write a shell script called `species.sh` that takes any number of
filenames as command-line parameters, and uses `cut`, `sort`, and
`uniq` to print a list of the unique species appearing in each of
those files separately.

#### Challenge 2

Write a shell script called `longest.sh` that takes the name of a
directory and a filename extension as its parameters, and prints
out the name of the file with the most lines in that directory
with that extension. For example:

~~~
$ bash longest.sh /tmp/data pdb
~~~

would print the name of the `.pdb` file in `/tmp/data` that has
the most lines.

#### Challenge 3

If you run the command:

~~~
history | tail -5 recent.sh
~~~

the last command in the file is the `history` command itself, i.e.,
the shell has added `history` to the command log before actually
running it. In fact, the shell *always* adds commands to the log
before running them. Why do you think it does this?

#### Challenge 4

Joel's `data` directory contains three files: `fructose.dat`,
`glucose.dat`, and `sucrose.dat`. Explain what a script called
`example.sh` would do when run as `bash example.sh *.dat` if it
contained the following lines:

~~~
# Script 1
echo *.*
~~~

~~~
# Script 2
for filename in $1 $2 $3
do
    cat $filename
done
~~~

~~~
# Script 3
echo $@.dat
~~~
