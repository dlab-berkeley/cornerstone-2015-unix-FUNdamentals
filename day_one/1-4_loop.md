Wildcards and tab completion are two ways to reduce typing (and typing mistakes). Another is to tell the shell to do something over and over again.

Wildcards and tab completion are two ways to reduce typing (and typing mistakes). Another is to tell the shell to do something over and over again.

Let's go back to our programming-fundamentals/data/articles directory, where we have over 1000 text articles on different regions of the world.

Let's say we'd like to make a backup directory called 'backup' and copy our articles in there, renaming each one `original-africa1.txt` and `original-africa2.txt`.

First we can make a directory and copy our files:

~~~ {.input}
$ cd ~/programming-fundamentals/data/articles
$ mkdir backup
$ cp *.txt backup
$ ls backup
~~~

So far so good. But when we try to rename the files, we can't use:

~~~ {.input}
$ cd backup
$ mv *.txt original-*.txt
~~~

because that would expand to:

~~~ {.input}
$ mv africa1.txt africa2.txt ... west999.txt original-*.txt
~~~

This wouldn't back up our files, instead we get an error

~~~ {.error}
mv: target `original-*.txt' is not a directory
~~~

This is because there are no files matching the wildcard `original-*.txt`.
In this case, Bash passes the unexpanded wildcard as a parameter to the `mv` command.

### Loops

Instead, we can use a **loop** to do some operation once for each thing in a list. Here's a simple example that displays the word counts of each file in turn:


~~~ {.input}
$ for filename in africa1.text africa2.txt
 do
    wc -w $filename
 done
~~~
~~~ {.output}
 539 africa1.txt
 243 africa2.txt
~~~

When the shell sees the keyword `for`, it knows it is supposed to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each thing in a list. In this case, the list is the two filenames.

### Variables

Each time through the loop, the name of the thing currently being operated on is assigned to the **variable** called `filename`. Inside the loop, we get the variable's value by putting `$` in front of it: `$filename` is `africa1.txt` the first time through the loop, `africa2.txt` the second, and so on.

By using the dollar sign we are telling the shell interpreter to treat `filename` as a variable name and substitute its value on its place, but not as some text or external command. When using variables it is also  possible to put the names into curly braces to clearly delimit the variable name: `$filename` is equivalent to `${filename}`, but is different from `${file}name`. You may find this notation in other people's programs.

Finally, the command that's actually being run is our old friend `wc`,
so this loop prints out the word count of each data file in turn.

> us that we haven't finished typing a complete command yet.

We have called the variable in this loop `filename` in order to make its purpose clearer to human readers. The shell itself doesn't care what the variable is called; if we wrote this loop as:

~~~ {.input}
$ for x in africa1.text africa2.txt
 do
    wc -w $filename
 done
~~~

or:

~~~ {.input}
$ for temperature in africa1.text africa2.txt
 do
    wc -w $temperature
 done
~~~

it would work exactly the same way. *Don't do this.* Programs are only useful if people can understand them, so meaningless names (like `x`) or misleading names (like `temperature`) increase the odds that the program won't do what its readers think it does.

### More Loops

Here's a slightly more complicated loop:

~~~ {.input}
for filename in africa*.txt
do
    echo $filename
    tail -1 $filename | wc -w
done
~~~
~~~ {.output}
...
africa97.txt
     515
africa98.txt
     653
africa99.txt
     597
~~~

The shell starts by expanding `africa*.txt` to create the list of files it will process. The **loop body** then executes two commands for each of those files. The first, `echo`, just prints its command-line parameters to standard output. For example:

~~~ {.input}
$ echo hello there
~~~

prints:

~~~ {.output}
hello there
~~~

In this case, since the shell expands `$filename` to be the name of a file, `echo $filename` just prints the name of the file. Note that we can't write this as:

~~~ {.input}
for filename in africa*.txt
do
    $filename
    tail -1 $filename | wc -w
done
~~~

because then the first time through the loop, when `$filename` expanded to `africa1.txt`, the shell would try to run `africa1.txt` as a program. Finally, the `tail` and `wc` combination computes the word count of the last line of each file.

> That's a problem: `head` can't read files called `red` and `dragon.dat`

> filenames.

### A Loopy Solution

Going back to our original file renaming problem, we can solve it using this loop:

~~~ {.input}
for filename in *.txt
do
    mv $filename original-$filename
done
~~~

This loop runs the `mv` command once for each filename. The first time, when `$filename` expands to `africa1.txt`, the shell executes:

~~~ {.input}
mv africa1.txt original-africa1.txt
~~~

The second time, the command is:

~~~ {.input}
mv africa2.txt original-africa2.txt
~~~

> #### Measure Twice, Run Once

> isn't foolproof, but it's a handy way to see what's going to happen when
> you're still learning how loops work..

### History

Another way to repeat previous work is to use the `history` command to get a list of the last few hundred commands that have been executed, and then to use `!123` (where "123" is replaced by the command number) to repeat one of those commands. For example, if Rochelle types this:

~~~
$ history | tail -5
  474  for filename in *.txt; do sed -i".bak" '1d' $filename; done
  475  cat africa1.txt
  476  rm *.bak
  477  history | tail -5
~~~

then she can re-run `cat africa1` simply by typing `!475`.

## Exercises

#### Challenge 1

Suppose that `ls` initially displays:

~~~
fructose.dat    glucose.dat   sucrose.dat
~~~

What is the output of:

~~~
for datafile in *.dat
do
    ls *.dat
done
~~~

#### Challenge 2

What is the effect of this loop?

~~~
for sugar in fructose.dat glucose.dat sucrose.dat
do
    echo $sugar
    cat $sugar xylose.dat
done
~~~

1.  Prints `fructose.dat`, `glucose.dat`, and `sucrose.dat`, and
    copies `sucrose.dat` to create `xylose.dat`.
2.  Prints `fructose.dat`, `glucose.dat`, and `sucrose.dat`, and
    concatenates all three files to create `xylose.dat`.
3.  Prints `fructose.dat`, `glucose.dat`, `sucrose.dat`, and
    `xylose.dat`, and copies `sucrose.dat` to create `xylose.dat`.
4.  None of the above.

#### Challenge 3

The `expr` does simple arithmetic using command-line parameters:

~~~
$ expr 3 + 5
8
$ expr 30 / 5 - 2
4
~~~

Given this, what is the output of:

~~~
for left in 2 3
do
    for right in $left
    do
        expr $left + $right
    done
done
~~~
