The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories is called the **file system**. It organizes our data into files, which hold information, and directories (also called "folders"), which hold files or other directories.

Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories. To start exploring them, let's open a shell window:

~~~ {.input}
$
~~~

The dollar sign is a **prompt**, which shows us that the shell is waiting for input; your shell may show something more elaborate.

Type the command `whoami`, then press the Enter key (sometimes marked Return) to send the command to the shell.

The command's output is the ID of the current user, i.e., it shows us who the shell thinks we are:

~~~ {.input}
$ whoami
~~~
~~~ {.output}
oski
~~~

More specifically, when we type `whoami` the shell:

1.  finds a program called `whoami`,
2.  runs that program,
3.  displays that program's output, then
4.  displays a new prompt to tell us that it's ready for more commands.

### Home Directories

Next, let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd` (which stands for "print working directory").

At any moment, our **current working directory** is our current default directory, i.e., the directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in  unless we explicitly specify something else.

Here, the computer's response is `/home/oski`, which is the **home directory**:

~~~ {.input}
$ pwd
~~~
~~~ {.output}
/home/oski
~~~

To understand what a "home directory" is, let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized. At the top is the **root directory** that holds everything else.

We refer to it using a slash character `/` on its own; this is the leading slash in `/home/oski`.

Inside that directory are several other directories: `bin` (which is where some built-in programs are stored), `data` (holding miscellaneous data files) `etc` (where local configuration files are stored), `tmp` (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term), and so on.

We know that our current working directory `/home/oski` is stored inside `/home` because `/home` is the first part of its name. Similarly, we know that `/home` is stored inside the root directory `/` because its name begins with `/`.

> Notice that there are two meanings for the `/` character.
> When it appears at the front of a file or directory name,

> it's just a separator.

### Listing

Let's see what's in Rochelle's home directory by running `ls`, which stands for "listing":

~~~ {.input}
$ ls
~~~
~~~ {.output}
data       file.txt                  Public                     Videos
Desktop    Music                     R
Documents  Pictures                  setup_ipython_notebook.sh
Downloads  programming-fundamentals  Templates
~~~

`ls` prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in alphabetical order, arranged neatly into columns.

We can make its output more comprehensible by using the **flag** `-F`, which tells `ls` to add a trailing `/` to the names of directories:

~~~ {.input}
$ ls -F
~~~
~~~ {.output}
data/       Music/                     setup_ipython_notebook.sh*
Desktop/    Pictures/                  Templates/
Documents/  programming-fundamentals/  Videos/
Downloads/  Public/
file.txt    R/
~~~

Here,
we can see that `/home/oski` contains 11 **sub-directories**.
The names that don't have trailing slashes, like `file.txt` are plain old files.

And note that there is a space between `ls` and `-F`: without it, the shell thinks we're trying to run a command called `ls-F`, which doesn't exist.

Now let's take a look at what's in Rochelle's `data` directory by running `ls -F data`, i.e., the command `ls` with the **arguments** `-F` and `data`. The second argument --- the one *without* a leading dash --- tells `ls` that
we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:

~~~ {.input}
$ ls -F data
~~~
~~~ {.output}
articles/  articles.txt  bar.txt  foo.txt  recipes/
~~~

The output shows us that there are four text files and two sub-sub-directories.Organizing things hierarchically in this way helps us keep track of our work: it's possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory, just as it's possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk, but it's a self-defeating strategy.

Notice, by the way that we spelled the directory name `data`. It doesn't have a trailing slash: that's added to directory names by `ls` when we use the `-F` flag to help us tell things apart. And it doesn't begin with a slash because it's a **relative path**, i.e., it tells `ls` how to find something from where we are, rather than from the root of the file system.

> #### Parameters vs. Arguments
>
> According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)#Parameters_and_arguments),

> In practice, however, most people use them interchangeably or inconsistently,

If we run `ls -F /data` (*with* a leading slash) we get a different answer,
because `/data` is an **absolute path**:

~~~ {.input}
$ ls -F /data
~~~
~~~ {.output}
access.log    backup/    hardware.cfg
network.cfg
~~~

The leading `/` tells the computer to follow the path from the root of the file system, so it always refers to exactly one directory, no matter where we are when we run the command.

What if we want to change our current working directory? Before we do this, `pwd` shows us that we're in `/home/oski`, and `ls` without any arguments shows us that directory's contents:

~~~ {.input}
$ pwd
~~~
~~~ {.output}
/home/oski
~~~
~~~ {.input}
$ ls
~~~
~~~ {.output}
data       file.txt                  Public                     Videos
Desktop    Music                     R
Documents  Pictures                  setup_ipython_notebook.sh
Downloads  programming-fundamentals  Templates
~~~

### Moving Around

We can use `cd` followed by a directory name to change our working directory. `cd` stands for "change directory", which is a bit misleading: the command doesn't change the directory, it changes the shell's idea of what directory we are in.

~~~ {.input}
$ cd programming-fundamentals
~~~

`cd` doesn't print anything, but if we run `pwd` after it, we can see that we are now in `/home/oski/data`.

If we run `ls` without arguments now, it lists the contents of `/home/oski/data`, because that's where we now are:

~~~ {.input}
$ pwd
~~~
~~~ {.output}
/home/oski/programming-fundametnals
~~~
~~~ {.input}
$ ls -F
~~~
~~~ {.output}
0-0_Introduction.md  1-1_fildir.md  1-4_loop.md     2-0_help.md  madlib.py
0-1_BCE.md           1-2_create.md  1-5_scripts.md  data/        README.md
1-0_shell.md         1-3_pipe.md    1-6_python.md   LICENSE      resource.md
~~~

We now know how to go down the directory tree: how do we go up? We could use an absolute path:

~~~ {.input}
$ cd /home/oski/
~~~

but it's almost always simpler to use `cd ..` to go up one level:

~~~ {.input}
$ pwd
~~~
~~~ {.output}
/home/oski/data
~~~
~~~ {.input}
$ cd ..
~~~

`..` is a special directory name meaning "the directory containing this one",
or more succinctly, the **parent** of the current directory. Sure enough, if we run `pwd` after running `cd ..`, we're back in `/home/oski/`:

~~~ {.input}
$ pwd
~~~
~~~ {.output}
/home/oski/
~~~

The special directory `..` doesn't usually show up when we run `ls`. If we want to display it, we can give `ls` the `-a` flag:

~~~ {.input}
$ ls -a
~~~
~~~ {.output}
.              .gnome                    .rstudio-desktop
..             .ICEauthority             setup_ipython_notebook.sh
.bash_history  .ipynb_checkpoints        .subversion
.bash_logout   .ipython                  Templates
.bashrc        .local                    .thumbnails
.cache         .mozilla                  .vboxclient-clipboard.pid
.config        Music                     .vboxclient-display.pid
data           Pictures                  .vboxclient-draganddrop.pid
.dbus          .pip                      .vboxclient-seamless.pid
Desktop        .pki                      .vbox_version
Documents      .profile                  Videos
Downloads      programming-fundamentals  .Xauthority
file.txt       Public                    .xsession-errors
.gconf         R                         .xsession-errors.old
.gitconfig     .Rhistory
~~~

`-a` stands for "show all"; it forces `ls` to show us file and directory names that begin with `.`, such as `..` (which, if we're in `/home/oski`, refers to the `/users` directory).

> #### Hidden Files: For Your Own Protection

As you can see, it also displays another special directory that's just called `.`, which means "the current working directory". It may seem redundant to have a name for it, but we'll see some uses for it soon.

> `/home/oski/elsewhere`.


## Rochelle's Pipeline: Getting Ready

In order to start her text analysis project, Rochelle first has to figure out where her data is stored.

Everything Rochelle needs for her text project is in the `data` directory of the git repository (i.e. the directory) `programming-fundamentals`. So Rochelle will migrate there.


~~~ {.input}
$ cd ~/programming-fundamentals/data
$ ls
~~~
~~~ {.output}
articles  downloads 
~~~

Each of Rochelle's text files is labeled according to the parameters leading to her LexisNexis Search. Since she searched and downloaded articles containing the phrase 'human rights' for each year, she will call her files `human-rights-2001.txt`, `human-rights-2002.txt`, and so on. All files are in currently in the `downloads` directory.

~~~ {.input}
$ cd downloads
$ ls
~~~
~~~ {.output}
human-rights-2000.TXT  human-rights-2004.TXT  human-rights-2008.TXT
human-rights-2001.TXT  human-rights-2005.TXT  human-rights-2009.TXT
human-rights-2002.TXT  human-rights-2006.TXT
human-rights-2003.TXT  human-rights-2007.TXT
~~~

If she is in her home directory, Rochelle can see what files she has using the command:

~~~ {.input}
$ cd ~
$ ls programming-fundamentals/data/downloads
~~~

This is a lot to type, but she can let the shell do most of the work. If she types:

~~~ {.input}
$ ls prog
~~~

and then presses tab, the shell automatically completes the directory name for her:

~~~ {.input}
$ ls programming-fundamentals/
~~~

Pressing tab again does nothing, since there are multiple possibilities. Pressing tab twice brings up a list of all the files and directories, and so on.

This is called **tab completion**, and we will see it in many other tools as we go on.

> file/directory in the GUI (in BCE: click on file, type `CTRL + c`) and paste 
> it into your shell (in BCE: `CTRL + Shift + v`). The full path of the file

## Exercises

#### Challenge 1

If `pwd` displays `/home/oski/programming-fundamentals`, what will `ls ../documents` display?

1.  `../documents: No such file or directory`
2.  `bce-help.desktop  Shared`
3.  `bce-help.desktop/  Shared/`
4.  no output.

#### Challenge 2

If `pwd` displays `/home/oski`, and `-r` tells `ls` to display things in reverse order, what command will display:
~~~
Videos/                     Public/                    Music/      Documents/
Templates/                  programming-fundamentals/  file.txt    Desktop/
setup_ipython_notebook.sh*  Pictures/                  Downloads/  data/
~~~

1.  `ls pwd`
2.  `ls -r -F`
3.  `ls -rF `
4.  Either \#2 or \#3 above, but not \#1.

#### Challenge 3

What does the command `cd` without a directory name do?

1.  It has no effect.
2.  It changes the working directory to `/`.
3.  It changes the working directory to the user's home directory.
4.  It produces an error message.

#### Challenge 4
